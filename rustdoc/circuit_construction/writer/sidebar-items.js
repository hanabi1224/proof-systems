It carries the index for the next available variable, and the vector of [GateSpec] created so far. It also keeps track of the queue of generic gates and cached constants."],["Var","A variable in our circuit. Variables are assigned with an index to differentiate from each other.

It allows for different behaviours depending on the struct for which it is implemented for. In particular, the circuit mode and the witness generation mode."]]};
